        <h2>Our Mission</h2>

            <p>
            We started this business, CFree (Cancer Free), as a way to help contribute to the fight to cure blood cancer. 10% of all profits from CFree will go towards a cancer-related spotlight charity. The first
            spotlight charity is The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, a non-profit whose goal it is to cure blood cancer.
            The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (LLS) is a non-profit with the goal of curing blood cancer. Over the course of last year, 8 of the treatment that LLS helped fund have been approved by the FDA.
            Furthermore, many of the methods devised for treatment of blood cancers have shifted to be used for treatment of a number of other cancers. We chose LLS as our Spotlight Charity since our family has been
            involved with LLS for over two decades at this point, ever since our father was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma.
